# Blinkit-Data-Analysis-Dashboard
This project is a fully interactive Excel dashboard that visualizes Blinkit's sales performance using key metrics like Total Sales, Average Sales, Number of Items, and Ratings. It provides deep insights across multiple dimensions including item type, fat content, outlet size, and year.
# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The dashboard highlights the following KPIs:

🧾 Total Sales – Overall revenue across all items and outlets

📈 Average Sales – Per-item or per-order sales insights

📦 Number of Items – Total distinct items sold

⭐ Average Rating – Customer feedback metric to assess product performance
